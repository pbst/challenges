Collection of (some) rode0day challenge with minor modifications to allow them
to be used by tame-rabbit.

I did not have capacity to run all of the rode0day challenges, so only a small
subset got imported. Other challenges should work as well, in case you want
more tests.

To generate even more challenges have a look at the
[lava](https://github.com/panda-re/lava) framework. This is how the rode0day
challenges got generated. But for bigger code sizes the process took too long.

In `./dev/` are challenges I generated with lava. The dated directories contain
the adapted rode0day challenges.
